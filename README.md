# SodokuGen
I made this so it can generate sodoku boards. Each time you hit the generate button, it creates a unique board that adheres to the rules of sodoku (hopefully). I am going to work on it so you can interact with the puzzle and solve it.

6/14/23: I added a dark mode theme and a button to switch between the two but its all just a lot of css and who uses light mode theme anyways so im getting rid of it, currently working on making the puzzles solvable
